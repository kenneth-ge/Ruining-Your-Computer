# Ruining-Your-Computer
## This repository contains various programs that will use the Microsoft winuser.h API and Java Robot to do various cool troll things on your computer. Written in C++ and Java. 

## shutdown.cpp/shutdown.jar
The original, the GOATed OG! Will shut down your computer by pressing WIN + X and then navigating to the shutdown button and pressing enter. The cause of many a prank back in high school. 

Note that shutdown.jar only works on Windows 10 (and may not work on all devices depending on the screen aspect ratio. Oops!)

## troll.cpp and troll.jar
That one program that my middle school tech teacher accidentally ran in class one day (oops). Will click on random things on your screen and type random characters at the same time until you manually press the button to shut down your PC. 

## monkeytype.cpp
Used for zen (freetype) mode. Types a bunch of Xs super fast and gives you a really high wpm. See Screenshot...png for the results.
